### Hi there 👋

My name is Ardi Jorganxhi, 20 years old adult studying Computer Engineering. My biggest motivation in this life is to learn new things about programming and use them in benefit of my people in Kosovo and other countries. I'm always trying to learn new things and improve myself at Computer Engineering field and I believe that I can achieve a great success one day with hard work.
